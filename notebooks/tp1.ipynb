    "# Conclusiones\n",
    "\n",
    "- Se comenzó con un modelo base tipo GPT sencillo, suficiente para pruebas preliminares, pero limitado en capacidad de generación de texto coherente.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Se analizaron distintos esquemas de muestreo:\n",
    "  - Greedy: genera texto coherente pero repetitivo.\n",
    "  - Temperatura: ajusta aleatoriedad; valores altos diversifican, bajos estabilizan.\n",
    "  - Top-k / Top-p: balance entre calidad y diversidad, evitando salidas triviales o erráticas.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Intentos de mejora: Se probaron ajustes de hiperparámetros y tamaño del dataset original, con algunas mejoras leves aunque casi imperceptibles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uso de MoE: La incorporación de Mixture of Experts permitió escalar el modelo sin aumentar linealmente los costos computacionales, intentando mejorar la capacidad de representación, aunque el resultado fue pobre en base a no haber escalado lo suficiente el modelo ni los datos de entrenamiento.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Además de las posibles mejoras en el modelo original, caben destacar posibles mejoras en la clase Expert: Explorar activaciones más avanzadas (GeLU, SwiGLU), residual connections, o regularización adicional para mayor robustez."
